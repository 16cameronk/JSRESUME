A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Gothburz/pen/YyLMVx.

 I made this header in a resume format that lists  my development & design skills. The thought process was that potential clients and employers would be visiting my CodePen account so make it pop.  I thought it would be nice to have a creative, organized way to display my relevant skill sets  other than strictly digging through my pens. I then customized my CodePen Pro profile around this pen.
